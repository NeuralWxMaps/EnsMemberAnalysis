# EnsMemberAnalysis
Plots of ensemble member content to verify neural network node assignments

After data from an ensemble model run has been run through the Self-Organizing algorithm and a Phase-Space plot has been generated, it is necessary to verify that clusters
on the Phase-Space plot represent similar weather patterns.  This page shows some collections of individual member plots, organized by their location on the Phase-Space 
plot.  Averaged values of the different clusters are also included, for comparison to an ensemble mean field calculated using all 31 ensemble members.
