# EnsMemberAnalysis
Plots of ensemble member content to verify neural network node assignments

The Self-Organizing Map algorithm does a very good job of assigning given patterns to the various neural network nodes. But are the assignments valid? When two patterns
are assigned to the same neural network node, are the patterns a close match?  Or, if two patterns are assigned to nodes that are remote from each other, do they represent
two unique patterns?  A detailed look at the individual ensemble members, sorted according to their position on the neural network phase-space plot is necessary to confirm
the validity of the SOM algorithm.  

This page will show several examples of forecast output, hopefully showing neighboring nodes with similar patterns and remote nodes showing dissimilar patterns.
